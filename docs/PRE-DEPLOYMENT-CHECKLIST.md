---

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL - Must Complete Before Launch

### 1. Create Missing Assets ⚠️

**OG Image for Social Sharing:**
- [ ] Create `public/og-image.jpg` (1200x630px)
  - Should include: MMR Burwan logo, tagline, and key visual
  - Use high-quality image with text readable at small sizes
  - Follow brand colors (gold/rose theme)
  - **Tool:** Canva, Figma, or Photoshop
  - **Note:** Currently referenced in `index.html` and `components/SEO.tsx`

---

### 2. Environment Variables Setup 🔐

**Required Environment Variables:**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory (NEVER commit this file):

```env
# Supabase Configuration (REQUIRED)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Optional - Only if using Gemini AI features
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

**For Production Deployment:**
- [ ] Set environment variables in your hosting platform:
  - **Vercel:** Project Settings → Environment Variables
  - **Netlify:** Site Settings → Environment Variables
  - **Cloudflare Pages:** Pages → Settings → Environment Variables
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Test that Supabase connection works in production

**Important Security Notes:**
- ✅ Supabase anon key is safe to expose (it's public by design)
- ✅ Never expose service role keys or API secrets
- ✅ Use environment variables, never hardcode secrets

---

### 3. Update Domain URLs 🌐

**Replace `https://mmrburwan.com` with your actual domain in:**

- [ ] `index.html` (all meta tags - lines 8, 20, 23, 39, etc.)
- [ ] `public/robots.txt` (line 2, 21)
- [ ] `public/sitemap.xml` (all `<loc>` tags - lines 9, 17, 25, 33)
- [ ] `public/manifest.json` (if needed - currently doesn't have domain)
- [ ] `components/SEO.tsx` (lines 17, 18, 23)
- [ ] `components/StructuredData.tsx` (lines 17, 18, 28, 29, 59, 70)
- [ ] `components/Footer.tsx` (line 67 - if using actual domain)
- [ ] `supabase/functions/send-verification-email/index.ts` (line 9)
- [ ] `supabase/functions/send-rejection-email/index.ts` (line 8)

**Quick Find & Replace:**
```bash
# Search for all occurrences
grep -r "mmrburwan.com" .
```

---

### 4. SSL/HTTPS Setup 🔒

- [ ] SSL certificate installed on hosting platform
- [ ] HTTPS redirect configured:
  - **Option A:** Uncomment HTTPS redirect in `public/.htaccess` (lines 32-37) if using Apache
  - **Option B:** Configure redirect in hosting platform settings (Vercel/Netlify handle this automatically)
- [ ] Verify all internal links use HTTPS
- [ ] Test that mixed content warnings don't appear

---

### 5. Supabase Configuration ☁️

**Backend Setup:**
- [ ] Database migrations applied to production Supabase project
- [ ] Edge Functions deployed:
  ```bash
  supabase functions deploy send-verification-email
  supabase functions deploy send-rejection-email
  supabase functions deploy create-proxy-user
  ```
- [ ] Edge Function secrets configured in Supabase Dashboard:
  - `RESEND_API_KEY` (for email sending)
  - `FROM_EMAIL` (sender email address)
  - `SITE_URL` (your production domain)
  - `SUPABASE_URL` (auto-set)
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (auto-set)

**Database Setup:**
- [ ] All tables created and migrated
- [x] ~~Storage policies configured (`supabase/storage-policies.sql`)~~ — LEGACY, no longer needed (storage is on R2)
- [ ] Admin user created (run `scripts/set-admin-role.sql` or use dashboard)
- [ ] Row Level Security (RLS) policies enabled and tested

**Storage (Cloudflare R2 — Primary File Storage):**
- [x] R2 bucket created (`mmr-burwan-storage`)
- [x] Bucket CORS configured for web uploads
- [x] Public R2.dev access enabled (`https://pub-02676075cda841f8aa773beeab8aa4a8.r2.dev`)
- [x] Application code migrated to use R2 via `lib/storage.ts` (AWS S3-compatible SDK)
- [ ] R2 API token created (Object Read & Write) and added to `.env.local` & production environment variables
- [ ] Run file migration: `node scripts/migrate-storage.mjs` (copies files from Supabase → R2)
- [ ] Run URL migration: `node scripts/update-storage-urls.mjs --dry-run` (preview DB URL changes)
- [ ] Run URL migration: `node scripts/update-storage-urls.mjs` (rewrite old Supabase URLs → R2 in DB)
- [ ] Test file upload/download functionality
- [ ] Supabase storage policies (`supabase/storage-policies.sql`) are LEGACY — no longer needed for new deployments

---

### 6. Email Configuration 📧

**Resend Setup (or your email provider):**
- [ ] Create Resend account or configure email provider
- [ ] Verify domain (if using custom domain)
- [ ] Add `RESEND_API_KEY` to Supabase Edge Function secrets
